# FilmBox
FilmBox is a movie rental system that lets customers sign in, rent movies for a period of time, and register when they return them. The purpose of this project is to give us experience in making database systems for real businesses. This project is relevant because it forces us to learn how to make the basic operations for Database systems (CRUD) work in a real project.
